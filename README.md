## nyoom
#### Created by Semuel Leijten for CSD2D at the HKU University of Arts Utrecht (2025)

A stereo audio effect plugin that can make any sound go nyoom.
The Doppler effect is simulated by modulating a fractional interpolating 
delay line based on the distance from the listener to the object passing by.

At the time of uploading this is a rough first version that I made for a school assignment and is by no means perfect, but I had fun working on it and learned a lot. 
I might revise some stuff at some point if I feel like it, feel free to make changes that suit your needs.
